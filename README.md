## Is there any relation between cancer death rate and GDP for all the countries around the world?

We were interested in cancer mortality rate among different nations . Cancer is among
the leading causes of death worldwide. In 2012, there were 14.1 million new cases and
8.2 million cancer-related deaths worldwide.57% of new cancer cases in 2012 occurred
in less developed regions of the world that include Central America and parts of Africa
and Asia; 65% of cancer deaths also occurred in these regions.The number of new
cancer cases per year is expected to rise to 23.6 million by 2030.
The Gross Domestic Product measures the value of economic activity within a country.
Strictly defined, GDP is the sum of the market values, or prices, of all final goods and
services produced in an economy during a period of time
In this project we tried to make a Dataset to see whether there is a correlation between
cancer rate deaths and the GDP. In less developed countries or regions rather than the
number of deaths per year was very huge which made us come with the following
questions:\
  ● Is there any relation between cancer death rate and GDP for all the countries
  around the world?\
  ● Which type of cancer is more common in a certain country?\
  ● How has the GDP rate being changing over the past 16 years from the year 2000
  to 2016 per country?

## Report
Full repoert about the project, procees and output is in <https://github.com/bfiroozfard/ETL_project/blob/master/ETL-PROJECT%20REPORT.pdf?

## Note
we did not load the Data file since they are huge .each 330 MB.There is a link the report for the source of Data. Report explain the proceed of ETL . We have 2 Jupyter note book. Project 2 is the main one .For did additional job to make "year"  as one column and it is in the other note book.(year_one _col)
